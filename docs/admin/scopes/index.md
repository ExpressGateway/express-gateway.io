### Overview Scopes API
Express Gateway utilizes scopes for permissions and basic authorization.
A scope is a tag you can use to mark API Endpoints and matching Consumer credentials.
Scopes can be used within any credential type. [Credentials and Scopes Management](../../credential-management) describes how scopes are declared within credentials

Scopes must be declared within Express Gateway before they are used by credentials or specified on API endpoints.
