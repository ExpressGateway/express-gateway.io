The Express Gateway roadmap consists of three parts:
1. features request and feedback in [Express Gateway Feathub](https://feathub.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway)
2. this document that captures all features under considered at the epic level
3. the [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/ExpressGateway/projects/1) that the Express Gateway contributors use to prioritize feature for the next release
