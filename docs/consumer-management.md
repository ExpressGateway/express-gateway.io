Express Gateway comes with a Consumer management system. An API consumer is either a user or application.

#### Users
A user, in its base form, consists of an ID and a username. The user model in `models` directory is schemaless and you define additional user properties.

Example:
```
Config: {
...
  User: {
  ...
    properties: {
      username:   { isMutable: false, isRequired: true}, #default, can be overridden
      firstName:  { isMutable: true, isRequired: true},
      lastName:   { isMutable: true, isRequired: true}
      ...
    }
  }
...
}
```

Note: 
`username` property is used by Express Gateway. Please avoid changing it since it may cause unexpected behaviour

#### Applications
An Application is another type of API consumer and is always associated to a user. A user may have zero to many applications.

In its base form, an application consists of an Id and userId. The `application` model in `models` directory is schemaless and you can define additional application properties.

Example:
```
Config: {
...
  Application: {
  ...
    properties: {
      name:   { isMutable: false, isRequired: true},
      group:  { isMutable: true, isRequired: false},
      ...
    }
  }
...
}
```

#### Credentials
A Credential is a container for secret authentication info. Always associated to a Consumer (User or App)

```js
{
  'basic-auth': {    
    passwordKey: 'password',
    autoGeneratePassword: true,
    properties: {
      scopes: { isRequired: false }
    }
  },
  'key-auth': {
    properties: {
      scopes: { isRequired: false }
    }
  },
  oauth2: {
    passwordKey: 'secret',
    autoGeneratePassword: true,
    properties: {
      scopes: { isRequired: false }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: 
`scopes` property is used by Express Gateway Autorization engine. Please avoid changing it since it may cause Autorization to work incorrectly

Properties can be introduced or removed. Also properties are configurable:   

##### Example
```js
newProperty: { 
    isRequired: true, 
    isMutable: true 
}
```

* `isRequired`
    - If true, CLI and Admin API will force validation if value is not provided

* `isMutable`
    - If true, Express Gateway will not allow modification of this property after creation
