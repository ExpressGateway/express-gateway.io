### Description

Express Gateway receives API requests on apiEndpoints, processes them, and then proxies them to downstream microservices. The serviceEndpoints section specifies the URLs of these proxied microservices.

### Usage

```yaml

serviceEndpoints:             # downstream microservices
  cats:                       # name, used as a reference in pipeline
    url: "http://cats1.example.com"
  dogs:                       # name, used as a reference in pipeline
    urls:                     # multiple urls can be used with load balancing
      - "http://dogs1.example.com"
      - "http://dogs2.example.com"
```
