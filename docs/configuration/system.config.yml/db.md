This section defines how Express Gateway stores it data.

Two ways possible for now: In Memory and Redis.

### In Memory database:
    - Data is reset on each process restart
    - Data is intact during Hot Reload operation
    - No need for Redis instance
    - Ideal for development
    - Should not be used in production

```yml
db:
  redis:
    emulate: true
```

### Redis database:
    - Persistant way of storing data
    - Requires Redis running
    - It should be used in production scenarious

```yml
db:
  redis:
    host: localhost
    port: 6379
    namespace: EG

```
