Policies are building blocks of functionality within Express Gateway. Policies can be thought of as wrappers around Express middleware that add dynamic evaluation and executional behavior through:
- a condition
- an action
- parameters

A policy can have one or many conditions and action pairs.  A condition and an action can each have their own set of unique parameters that make the pair unique.
