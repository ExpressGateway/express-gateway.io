### Description

The Basic Authorization policy follows the [RFC-7617 standard][rfc-7617-standard].
From the standard, if a user agent wanted to send the user-id "Aladdin" and password "open sesame", it would use the following HTTP header.

Example: `Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==`

### Usage

In order to use the Basic Authorization policy, consumers must be created and `basic-auth` credentials created for them.

To create consumers (users and apps): use the [CLI][cli] and [create user][users-create] or [create app][apps-create] command.

To create a `basic-auth` credential for an app or user: use the [CLI][cli] and [create credential][credentials-create] command with type `basic-auth`.

To enable the Basic Authorization policy, add `basic-auth` in [gateway.config.yml][gateway.config.yml] in the [policies][policies] section.

```yaml
policies:
  - basic-auth
  # other policies
```

### Example

```yaml

pipelines:
 pipeline1:
  apiEndpoints:
    - authorizedEndpoint
  policies:
    - basic-auth:
    - proxy:
        action:
          serviceEndpoint: backend

```

You can use cURL to test that the policy is working correctly:

`curl -H "Authorization: Basic base64encoded(username:password)" https://gatewayurl/api/testEndpoint`

**Note**: Make sure to replace the `base64encoded(username:password)` with the correct data generated by the gateway.

##### Options Reference

* `passThrough`:
  - determines whether the gateway should execute the successive policy in case the auth process fails. If set to false,
    the gateway will return an `Unauthorized` response.
  - default value: `false`
