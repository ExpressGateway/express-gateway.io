## Documentation

Welcome to Express Gateway! The documentation for Express Gateway is written using Jekyll and Markdown. If you'd like to contribute, please see our [Github website repo](https://github.com/expressgateway/express-gateway.io)

### Installing and Getting Started

Express Gateway runs on Node.js. To get Node.js please visit the [Node.js Downloads Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once you have Node.js installed, check out the dedicated [Getting Started Guide]


### Core Concepts 

To better understand what Express Gateway is and how it works, check out the [About] page that provides the big picture. 

### Configuration

One of the key features of Express Gateway is that configuration is completely separate from static code used to run the gateway.  

All configuration is centralized and can be found in the `/config` directory of the main Express Gateway folder.

Configuration is divided into different levels:

- gateway configuration: `gateway.config.yml`
- system level configuration: `system.config.yml`
- data configuration: `model-configs`

The levels allow you to configure and manage Express Gateway without having to concern yourself with details that may not be relevant to you as a user, operator, administrator or developer.

#### gateway.config.yml
All of the application functionality is embodied in the gateway.config.yml.  This config file describes the entire gateway's microservices and API operations at a glance.

gateway.config.yml is made up of the following sections:

- http
- https
- apiEndpoints
- serviceEndpoints
- policies enabled
- pipelines

Each section declares global named entities globally. These entities are then referenced within the Express Gateway pipeline.

#### http
The http section is used to configure HTTP. Express Gateway will listen on  the specified port for HTTP requests.

Options:
- `port:` the port to listen on

Usage:
{% highlight yaml %}
http:
    port: 9080 # EG will listen for http requests on port 9080
{% endhighlight %}

#### https
The https section is used to configure HTTPS. Express Gateway will listen on the specififed port for HTTPS requests.

Options:
- `port:` the port to listen on
- `tls:` a list of certificates

Express Gateway supports TLS, including SNI (domain specific TLS certificates). Each `tls` key can have a host domain specified.  Wildcards are supported for host domain matching. Paths to the TLS keys and certificates are specified in the `key` and `cert` keys as pairs.

The `default` key will be used if none of the other `tls` domain entries are matched or if SNI is not being used by the client.

Usage:
{% highlight yaml %}
https:
  port: 9443 # EG will listen for https requests on port 9443
  tls:
    - "*.demo.io":                  # will match any subdomain for demo.io
        key: keys/demo.io.key.pem
        cert: keys/demo.io.cert.pem
    - "api.acme.com":               # will only match api.acme.com
        key: keys/acme.com.key.pem
        cert: keys/acme.com.cert.pem
    - "default":                    # will be used if no match above or if SNI not used
        key: keys/eg.io.key.pem
        cert: keys/eg.io.cert.pem
{% endhighlight %}

#### apiEndpoints
API Endpoints are URLs that are exposed by the Express Gateway to listen to API requests.  They are specified in conjunction with the [http](#http) and [https](#https) sections.

Usage: minimum
{% highlight yaml %}
apiEndpoints:
  api:                  # the name of the API endpoint
{% endhighlight %}

Usage: 
{% highlight yaml %}
apiEndpoints:
  help: # name, used as reference in pipeline
    host: '*' # optional, by default accepts all hosts, same as '*'
    paths: /help #optional, by default will serve all requests - same as *

  api: # name, used as reference in pipeline
    host: '*.com' # wildcard pattern support
    paths:
      - '/v1/*' # string or array of strings
      - '/v2/*'

  example: # name, used as reference in pipeline
    host: 'example.com'
    paths: /v2/* # string or array of strings
{% endhighlight %}

#### Host

The `host` value is a string that will be matched against the 'HOST' header of the request.

Host examples: <TODO make this collapsible>
- \* - any domain will match cdn.test.example.com, test.example.com, example.com, etc. Will also work if no HOST header is provided
- example.com - one domain match, will not match subdomains
- \*.example.com -
    - any subdomain will match. test.example.com
    - example.com will not match
    - deeper levels will not match cdn.test.example.com
- \*.*.example.com
    - will match 2nd level subdomains like cdn.test.example.com
    - will not match example.com host
    - will not match test.example.com host

For host resolution Express Gateway relies on the "vhost" npm module. For more examples please see please refer to [https://www.npmjs.com/package/vhost](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vhost)

#### Paths
Paths can be either a string or array of strings.  Wildcard patterns are supported.  Paths follow the ExpressJS routes conventions - [https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router)

Path examples: <TODO make this collapsible>
* paths: /admin - exact string match
  + match: /admin
  + 404: /admin/new; /admin/new/1; /staff; /; etc.

* paths: /admin/\* - deep level sub directory matching (does not match the parent dir)
  + match: /admin/new /admin/new/1
  + 404: /admin

* paths: ['/admin', '/admin/\*']  - deep level sub directory matching and directory itself
  + match: /admin/new /admin/new/1 /admin

* paths: '/admin/:id' - one level sub directory matching without directory itself
  + match: /admin/new /admin/1 /admin/some-guid-here
  + 404: /admin; /admin/1/test; /admin/a/b/c;

* paths: '/admin/:group/:id' - two level sub directory matching without directory itself
  + match: /admin/eg/12
  + 404: /admin; /admin/1; /admin/a/b/c;

* paths: ['/student/\*', '/teacher/\*','/admin/\*']
  + match:
      - /admin/... multi-level
      - /student/... multi-level
      - /teacher/... multi-level
  + 404:
      - /
      - /admin; /teacher; /student
      - /random etc.

#### Overlapping
The order of the API endpoints specified matters. It is possible to specifiy overlapping patterns through wildcards. More specific patterns should be specified first for evaluation before more general matching.

Example:
{% highlight yaml %}
apiEndpoints:
  tabby:
    host: '*.tabby.cat.com'
    paths: '*'    # optional, default *
  cat:
    host: '*.cat.com'
  com:
    host: '*.com'
{% endhighlight %}

#### serviceEndpoints
Express Gateway receive API request on apiEndpoints, process them and then proxy them to the underlying microservices. The serviceEndpoints section specifies the URLs of these proxied microservices. 

Usage:
{% highlight yaml %}
serviceEndpoints: # urls to downstream microservices
  cats_service: # name, used as a reference in pipeline
    url: "http://localhost"
    port: 3000
    paths: /             # optional, defaults to /
  dogs_service: # name, used as a reference in pipeline
    url: http://localhost
    port: 4000
{% endhighlight %}
