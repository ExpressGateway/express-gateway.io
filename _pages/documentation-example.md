This text is **bold**, this is *italic*, this is an `inline code block`.

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.

> This is a blockquote. It will read centered and full length of the area it resides in.

All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. This is an [internal link](#error-code-definitions), this is an [external link](http://google.com). The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words

### List Styles

1. List item one
2. List Item two
    1. nested ordered List
    2. see the nesting
    3. Add Four Spaces To Nest Lists
        - Nested UL
        - Four Spaces
3. Maybe it works

## Rate-limit
The rate limiter policy is used to limit the number of requests received and processed by the API endpoint. Limits are useful to prevent your system from being overwhelmed in both benign and malevolent situations where the number of requests processed can overwhelm your underlying APIs and supporting services. Rate limits are also useful to control the amount of API consumption to a known capacity of quantity.

Example use case:
Use to limit repeated requests to public APIs and/or endpoints such as password reset.

#### Reference
conditions: (list all valid conditions)
action parameters:
`max`
`rateLimitBy`
`windowMs`


`max` - maximum number of requests

`rateLimitBy` - the criteria that is used to limit the number of requests by
The rate limit policy, by default will limit based on client IP address (req.ip).

valid values: username, appID, etc...

#### Usage Example


Consider example to rate-limit based on passed host:
{% highlight yaml linenos %}
apiEndpoints:
  example:
    host: '*'
serviceEndpoints:
  backend:
    url: 'http://www.example.com'
pipeline1:
    apiEndpoints:
      - 'example',
    policies:
      - rate-limit:
        -
          action:
            name: 'rate-limit'
            max: 10
            rateLimitBy: "${req.host}"
      - proxy:
        -
          action:
            name: proxy
            serviceEndpoint: backend
{% endhighlight %}

The preceding example will impose a rate limit by the calling host.  If the hosts calling the API endpoint are "partnerApp.amce.org" and "partnerApp.widget.com" then each host will be limited to 10 requests per (what's the internval???)
