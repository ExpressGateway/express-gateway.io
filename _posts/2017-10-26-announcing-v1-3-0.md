We’re pleased to announce we’ve released Express Gateway 1.3.0. This version fixes bugs and we're excited to share brand new features for developers to test drive!
<!--excerpt-->

#### Releasing Express Gateway v1.3.0

Get the latest bits from NPM: [express-gateway@1.3.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-gateway).

Express Gateway adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). As a result, v1.3.0 is fully compatible with
previous 1.x releases.

##### Install

```shell
$ npm install -g express-gateway
```

##### Upgrade

```shell
$ npm update -g express-gateway
```

##### Notable changes:

###### Added:

- The Admin API has been extended to let you control the gateway even more. In particular, pipelines, endpoints and allowed policies are now exposed.
- Express Gateway is now shipped with a Typescript definition file that should improve the experience when writing plugins. To know more about this feature, point your browser to the docs
- Express Gateway now has a built in schema validator for policies, plugins, options. This will prevent the gateway from starting if required parameters are not valid
- `eg credential list` command now accepts a -f parameter that will let you filter the credentials based on their status (so far, active and archived)

If interested, you can see the complete changelog on the [release page](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway/releases/tag/v1.3.0).
