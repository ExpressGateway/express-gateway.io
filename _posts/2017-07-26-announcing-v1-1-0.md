This morning we added the finishing touches of load balancing features into the proxy policy that Wyatt needed at Joyent.  Also added Windows support along with AppVeyor CI.

#### Releasing Express Gateway v1.1.0

Get the latest bits from NPM: [express-gateway@1.1.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-gateway).

Express Gateway adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).  As a result, v1.1.0 is fully compatible with previous 1.x releases.

##### Install

```shell
$ npm install -g express-gateway
```

##### Upgrade

```shell
$ npm update -g express-gateway
```

##### Release notes

###### Added

* Adding a basic round-robin load balancer ([#326](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway/pull/326))
* Windows Support and AppVeyor integration ([#342](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway/pull/342))

###### Changed

* Standardize CLI Output ([#343](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway/pull/343))

###### Fixed

* expireDate is now set and checked for Authorization Codes ([#344](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway/pull/344))
* Changing OAuth2 dialog to point to correct URL. ([#346](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway/pull/346))

#### New Feature: Load Balancing

With the v1.1.0 release, Express Gateway now supports load balancing.

A typical `serviceEndpoint` configuration identifies a single `url`.  The `proxy` policy uses this parameter to identify backend targets for incoming requests.

```yaml
serviceEndpoints:
  backend:
    url: "http://api.example.com"
```

What happens when a single target is not enough?  The load balancing feature allows Express Gateway to route traffic to more than one backend URL.

To enable load balancing, a service endpoint configuration requires a list of `urls`.

```yaml
serviceEndpoints:
  backend:
    urls:
      - "http://api1.example.com"
      - "http://api2.example.com"
```

The `proxy` policy will recognize multiple URLs associated with a service endpoint and look to an optional `strategy` parameter, defaulting to `round-robin`.

See the [proxy](https://www.express-gateway.io/docs/policies/proxy) and [serviceEndpoint](https://www.express-gateway.io/docs/configuration/gateway.config.yml/serviceEndpoints) documentation for more information.

### What's next?

##### Advanced Routing

More complex proxy rules will be introduced to do wildcard-based matching, similar to Express routing rules

##### Service Discovery & Orchestration

Integrations with Kubernetes, Consul, and other infrastructure components are currently under consideration.
