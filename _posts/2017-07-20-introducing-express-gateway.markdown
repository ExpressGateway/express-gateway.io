#### Today has been a long, long time coming!

This project is a culmination of listening to countless accounts from community folks with all types of different backgrounds - from startups to large enterprises and everything in between - and acting on it.

A lot has changed from the time that Express.js finally landed in the Node Foundation.  Node has continued to gain momentum. Cloud is becoming more and more tangible and real.  Microservices and APIs are starting to get the attention of even folks outside the technical field.

What's new is old, and what's old is now new.  Today we unveil an open source initiatve that has been in the making for quite some time now in its numerous incarnate forms.  For years, folks have been hand-rolling an API gateway as a proxy to their services and now microservices using Express with various quality of service capabilities.  Express Gateway is a codification of what the community has been doing all along and gives it shape and form.

Let's face it - this is a piece of infrastructure you don't want to have to build on your own. You have far greater concerns - like the core logic of your microservices and application. This is where leverage from the community comes into play and what open source is all about.

We wanted to take this opportunity to thank all the community members from Express.js both past and present. If it weren't for them, we woudln't have this fantastic foundation to build on.
