### Submitting Pull Requests
We use [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/ExpressGateway/express-gateway) to track work on the task board. Waffle uses keywords just like Github.

Please see the checklist below and thanks again for your contribution!

- [ ] open the pull request against the `dev` branch as the base - we use `dev` for staging before pushing to `master` for live changes
- [ ] please use "Connect #<Github Issue>" anywhere within the description
  - example) "fixes typo with OAuth2 policy - connect #103"
- [ ] branch naming prefix:
  - bugfix/branch-name (for bugs)
  - doc/branch-name (for doc additions)
- [ ] squash commits and/or rebase
